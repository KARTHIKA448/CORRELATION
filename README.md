# CORRELATION
about correlation and correlation in some datasets

in this notebook,we are discussing about correlation and correlation in some datasets :
CORRELATION: 
	* Correlation will tell you about the direction and magnitude of relationship b/w two variables
	* Correlation tells us how variables change together both in direction (same or opposite) and magnitude (strength of the relationship). To find the correlation, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, symbolized by œÅ (the Greek letter rho), by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the variables:
	* Correlation does not imply causation
